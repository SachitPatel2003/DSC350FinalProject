## Final Project from DSC 350: Machine Learning

This project involved a multi-class classification problem regarding credit score. Given a range of input features, predict the level of an individual's credit health, which ranges from Poor, Standard, and Good. Multiple different model attempts were used, and heavy preprocessing was done. 

Highlights include:
- Building Random Forest, MLP, and Gradient classifcation models with cross-validation.
- Seaborn used to create visualizations, as well as Confusion Matrices.
- Interpretation of built models using SHAP, SHAP plots utilized for interpretation.

This project was created in VSCode using both Python and Pandas code. Several visualizations were created, which can be found in the report.
